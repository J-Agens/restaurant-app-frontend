## Restaurant Order Visualizer
This is a single-page web-application for a restaurant to keep track of orders by table and calculate total prices. The main focus was to create something that requires very little typing, so that it could later be formatted for use on a tablet. A party can be added to a table simply by clicking on the table header and entering the party's name. Orders can be attached to the party by dragging the items from the menu and onto the **New Order** button. Alternatively, a custom order can be placed by clicking the button and entering the order information. As orders are added to the table, the total is calculated automatically. Orders can be marked as served when the are completed, and canceled by dragging the order onto the trash icon at the bottom of the screen.

## Demo
Follow [this link](https://sleepy-hollows-82798.herokuapp.com/), and be sure to give the app a few seconds to load as it's hosted on a free Heroku account. There should be some seed data on the page, if it doesn't appear right away, refresh the page.
